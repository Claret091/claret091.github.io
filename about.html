<h1>What you should know about Lentrick!</h1>
 <p> Photographer Payton Pitts has a distinct personal style that expresses itself through her About page. Her colloquial language is lively and approachable, important qualities that people take into account when hiring a professional photographer. 


Payton’s charming content allows audiences to connect with her: the section of fun facts about herself is a fantastic touch and her personable nature is underscored by genial photographs throughout the page. 


The use of parallax scrolling enables Payton to incorporate many elements onto one page without it looking too busy. And should a visitor to the page want more information about the photographer, they can click on her social media account profiles, or follow the subtle link to her testimonials section.
Iqoniq Creative's About Us page represents the entrepreneurial essence of our generation. The creative media group emphasizes clean visual elements that highlight their professional goals. A succinct text tells us about the company’s work, using a tone that tells us they’re the perfect match for clients who like hard work and have big goals, no matter their location.


Providing a partial client list on their About page is a nice move because it allows Iqoniq Creative to develop a sense of trust with their visitors. A slideshow of testimonials strengthens this credibility.

Ruby Love is an underwear brand using patent-pended technology to create leak-proof garments for women in their period. Their About Us page directly resonates with their target audience by featuring a photo of six smiling women and a clever headline that reads “No Tampon Required. Period.” 


Providing added value to the About Us page, a short excerpt tells us about founder Crystal Ettiene, and how Ruby Love began with her desire to give women freedom during ‘that time of the month’ and evolved into a full fledged business. 





A tasteful video and educational infographic teach visitors how the leak-proof technology works and explain why the products provide potential customers with security, comfort and peace of mind. 

2. Outline your company story.
Every business has a story to tell. Even if you're running a start-up, you might not have a long history of changes and growth (yet), but it's a nice touch to talk about how you got to where you are on the About page. So, isolate the milestones before your company's founding, and use them to give readers some backstory on your current venture.

3. Reveal how you've evolved.
There's no shame in admitting how your business strategy — or even your way of thinking — has changed since you began. In fact, these evolutions can improve the story you tell to website visitors.

About pages are perfect spaces to talk about where you started, how you've grown, and the ideals that have helped your organization mature. Use these moments to further your company story and show people that you're always ready to change and adapt to the needs of your industry.

4. State your "aha!" moment.
Every good company was founded on an idea — something the current marketplace might not yet offer. What was your idea? Use this "Aha!" moment as a pivot point when telling your company story. What was a challenge you faced while developing your company? How did this challenge or discovery shape what you are today?

5. Explain who you serve.
As much as you want as many eyeballs on your About page as possible, you won't do business with every single one of them. That's why you must identify and mention your core customer. This lets your visitors know what your business is dedicated to helping them meet their needs and goals.

6. Explain what you're offering them.
As you're explaining who you serve, make it clear what it is you're offering. Companies often generalize their products or services in the website copy, making it hard to understand what it is the customer is actually paying for. Sometimes, businesses are afraid that the literal explanations of their products aren't interesting enough or will sound unappealing in writing. And that's a fair concern.

However, investing just a sentence or two into telling your potential customers exactly what they'll receive can keep them on your website for longer and get them interested in learning more.

7. Cite examples of clients you've served.
Got some loyal customers in your portfolio? Use your About page to let the world know who already trusts and benefits from your work. A great way to showcase this is through a case study.

Knowing about your company's past successes can influence your prospects' purchasing decisions because they will be able to envision their success in the success of your past customers.

8. Describe your values.
Customers want to be treated like human beings. For that to happen, they need to feel that they're being served by human beings. When finishing your About page, describe who you are as a person or a team, and what your personal values are. What's your company culture like? What bigger picture in life drives your business?

Keep in mind a secondary audience of your company's About page consists of your future employees. This is another reason describing your personal values is a good idea — the key to your job candidates' hearts is to show them you </p>
